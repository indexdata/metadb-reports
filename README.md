# metadb-reports

This repository contains Metadb reports to be used with the FOLIO Reporting app, [ui-ldp](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-ldp). Reports are in the [report](reports) directory, naturally enough.

## Creating reports
Reports should be created following the [documentation](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-ldp/blob/master/doc/reports.md) for authoring reports for the FOLIO Reporting app.
